            The first week of in-person boot camp started this week and I had a blast. I am in Ian’s classroom and is a
            great resource for any questions I have. I also have 3 other great classmates Rachel, Duncan, and Chandler,
            as well as Becky on Zoom. They are all great help as well and, this week Chandler helped me figure out the
            issue I had with refactoring the bouncing balls project.
            <br> <br>
            I think the main thing that held me back was having things misspelled, there were multiple times where my
            code was right in theory, but I had spelt <b>“navbar”</b> like <b>“nvabar”</b> or something similar. There were other
            issues like me dwelling on problems and taking long amounts of time to dissect those. But overall I think I
            made good progress this week.
            <br> <br>
            When it comes to what I hope to learn more about with Javascript is Data Structures. I know from previous
            experience just how strong some Data Structures can be and knowing how to harness can make your life easier.
            As for Bootstrap I hope to just use only bootstrap and no CSS at all. This week Ian talked about using
            something I believe called templates so you never have to use CSS. I am excited to learn about that.
