# Blog
Blog is a blog that will cover my time spent in the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp and will slowly have features and functionality added. You can access it at https://skylerkk.github.io/Blog/ . This blog implements HTML and Bootstrap mainly with some CSS.

# Road Map
As stated above this will be updated as I progress through the bootcamp. There will be weekly blog post made pretaining to my experience at bootcamp. Also as I learn new languages and their functions I will try to put more features using that on the blog. 

# Contributing
Contributions are not open as this will be a site that will show my progress through the bootcamp.

# Development
Updates will keep being made till stated otherwise here.
