            The second week of in person bootcamp is in the books and it went well. One thing that was very helpful was the projects tab in github that helped me understand the development process a bit more. Now to the questions, I think to have good code you have to make code that is readable and reusable. Being a good developer is making good code and having good communication. I think programmers hate debugging because it can be very stressful.

            This week I was able to start the tic tac toe project and realized that I am going to fast when I do development. After the one on one with Justin and Ian I learned I need to slow down and pseudocode more and think out my process more. I also need to expand my toolbox so I can be more efficent when I code. So next week I am going to slow down and try not to write a single piece of code for the calculator project next Monday and just focus on pseudocode.
