            Bootcamp Week 3: Prework

            Third week of prework and we finally started with some javascript. This week has probably been my favorite so far. This week we made a splash page and a silly story generator. We also updated all of our blogs, I added an about and project menu option. For the about section of the site I fill it out with a short paragraph about me and some links to twitter, linkedin, and github. The projects tab is much more barren only having a placeholder for future projects we do in the bootcamp. All of this made me realize I should probably start refactoring process soon as my code is not the cleanest.

            Now answering the questions for this week. I think the role that the html, css, and javascript play is vital to the frontend experience the users interact with. Html lets you put all of the content on the page. CSS lets you make it look good. Javascript finally makes it responsive. Each of these rely on the other to make a fully function and in my opinion proper website. Now, on the topic of objects I do not really know what objects my blog incorporates. It has some functionality such as being responsive and a navigation bar. But besides that I don't really know what "objects" would be.
