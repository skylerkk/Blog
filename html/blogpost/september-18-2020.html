        <p class="blogpost-text">
            The last week of prework is over and there is a lot to reflect on. We went over Agile development which makes sense but does seem tedious. We also went over HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I liked all these subjects but did find HTML to get tedious at times. CSS also was fine but debugging it was a large task sometimes. Finally Javascript was just like any programming language when you are learning the syntax and I found myself banging my head against a keyboard stuck on issues multiple times.
            <br> <br>
            I think going through prework I found that Ian and Justin were both excellent instructors and are reliable to ask help from. I think the only thing that hindered my progress was my own incompetence at times, and think there were times where I could ask for help when I didn't. Finally, I overcame challenges by trying to break down the problem and take it one step at a time. Most of my challenges were debugging issues.
