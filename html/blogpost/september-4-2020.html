            Bootcamp Week 2: Prework

            Second week of pre-work is coming to a close and we did some more git work. As well as some html and css
            work. We learned about pseudocode and took a deep dive into it. I used pseudocode in the past to just lay
            out
            ideas and to explain what a peice of code is doing. But going forward I am going to put what we learned into
            practice. It makes so much more sense to layout pseudocode in how the code is going to be structured instead
            of just ideas. The advanced psuedocode project definitely helped me realize that.
            <br> <br>
            I am still struggling on having a steady schedule. Right now I am only getting roughly 5 hours of sleep a
            night which is something I need to fix. But besides that, I am exicted to get into
            next week of pre-work as I already looked and saw we are starting javascript. I really enjoy coding so I
            can't wait for next week. I have been doing hackerrank and a few codewars katas to prepare. Before next week
            I plan on at
            least doing 40+ katas on codewars so I feel comfortable going into week 3 of pre-work.
